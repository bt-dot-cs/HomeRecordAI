## STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS

### Foundation
- **Condition:** Fair

- Front slope: Architectural shingles, estimated 6–8 years remaining useful life
- Rear slope: Original slate tiles, 3 tiles cracked, 2 missing, active leak risk
- Flat roof section over rear addition: EPDM membrane showing significant UV degradation
- **Recommendation:** IMMEDIATE repair of rear slate and EPDM membrane. Budget $4,500–$7,000.

## MECHANICAL SYSTEMS

### HVAC
- **Heating:** Gas-fired forced air furnace, Carrier brand, installed 2009
  - Age: 15 years — approaching end of useful life (typically 18–20 years)
  - Last serviced: Unknown — filter heavily soiled
  - Heat exchanger: Visual inspection inconclusive, recommend pressure test
- **Cooling:** Window AC units only — no central cooling
- **Recommendation:** Service furnace immediately, budget for replacement within 3–5 years. Estimated replacement cost $5,500–$8,000.

### Plumbing
- Supply: Copper throughout, good condition
- Drain/Waste: Cast iron mains (original), PVC branch lines (updated)
- Water heater: State brand, 40-gallon gas, installed 2017 — 7 years old, mid-life
- Pressure tested at 68 PSI — within normal range
- Minor drip at kitchen shutoff valve under sink
- **Recommendation:** Replace kitchen shutoff valve ($150–$200). Monitor cast iron drains for corrosion.

### Electrical
- **Panel:** Federal Pacific Electric Stab-Lok, 100-amp service
- ⚠️ **SAFETY CONCERN:** Federal Pacific Stab-Lok panels have documented failure rates and are associated with increased fire risk. Insurance companies may refuse coverage or surcharge.
- No GFCI protection in bathrooms or kitchen
- Several double-tapped breakers observed
- Knob-and-tube wiring remnants in attic (appears inactive but unconfirmed)
- **Recommendation:** Panel replacement is strongly advised. Budget $3,500–$5,500. GFCI installation required.
